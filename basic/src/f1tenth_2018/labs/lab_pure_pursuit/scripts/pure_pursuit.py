    # Note: These following numbered steps below are taken from R. Craig Coulter's paper on pure pursuit.

    # 1. Determine the current location of the vehicle (we are subscribed to vesc/odom)
    # Hint: Read up on PoseStamped message type in ROS to determine how to extract x, y, and yaw.
    

        

    # 2. Find the path point closest to the vehicle that is >= 1 lookahead distance from vehicle's current location.



    # 3. Transform the goal point to vehicle coordinates. 
    
    

    # 4. Calculate the curvature = 1/r = 2x/l^2
    # The curvature is transformed into steering wheel angle by the vehicle on board controller.
    # Hint: You may need to flip to negative because for the VESC a right steering angle has a negative value.
