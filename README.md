#F1TENTH

source code used by the ucsb f1tenth capstone team to control their car.

written for the intended use of ros noetic on ubuntu 20.04.

this repo contains three separate projects.

first, the "basic" directory contains the full code that was used to control the f1tenth car in 2018 by UPenn. we will not be using this structure, but we will draw from the layout and source code.

second, the 'simulator' directory contains the full code that was used to launch our first prototype demo. this is the structure we will use, but we need to adjust the code since it is only a simulator.

third, the 'velma' directory contains the full code that will be used for our final project. it is a work in progress.

the misc directory contains any extra files and the source code for each of the hardware drivers.
